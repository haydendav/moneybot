# moneybot

This is a personal app to track my money and make some data visualizations out of it. 

# running app

The database must be connected but this is how to start the application. Included mvnw and mvnw.cmd if needed to run. 

`mvn clean install` --clean and compile  
`mvn spring-boot:run` --runs project
